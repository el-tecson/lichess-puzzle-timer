## Overview
A Chrome extension that adds a **real-time timer** when solving puzzles on Lichess, mimicking the tension of actual games—especially **blitz** and **bullet** time controls.

## Features
- Timer appears automatically when you start a puzzle.
- Supports all Lichess puzzle modes.
- Minimal, lightweight, and distraction-free.

## Usage
- Start solving puzzles on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/training).
- The timer will appear in the top-right corner automatically.
- Start the timer and have fun!

## FAQs
### Q: The timer suddenly stops for some reason…
> Occasionally puzzles may load slowly due to Lichess server hiccups. This can pause the timer temporarily. This is **not a bug** in the extension.

### Q: Can I customize the timer?
> Yes, you can absolutely customize the timer in the extension's settings webpage.
