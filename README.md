# Lichess Puzzle Timer
Using this chrome extension, a timer will appear when solving puzzles in lichess. Mimicking the tension felt when playing in a real game, especially blitz and bullet time control.

## FAQs
### The timer suddenly stops for some reason...
Occasionally puzzles may load slowly due to Lichess server hiccups — this can pause the timer. This is not a bug in the extension.
